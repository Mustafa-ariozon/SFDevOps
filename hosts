# Create a file named "hosts" under the "ansible" directory and add the IP address and hostname of the machine to it as follows:
This inventory file has two groups: "webserver" and "database", and lists the IP addresses of the hosts in each group.

To use this inventory file with Ansible, save it to a file (e.g., "hosts") in your Ansible project directory (e.g., "~/ansible"), like this:
hoop@user:~/ansible# nano hosts

Command:

echo "[my_hosts]" > hosts
echo "xxx.xx.x.xx ansible_user=<your_username> ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your/ssh_key" >> hosts

Replace <your_username> with your username on the host machine and /path/to/your/ssh_key with the path to your SSH private key.
