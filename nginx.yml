# Open the nginx.yml file and modify it as follows:


- name: Copy nginx config file
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  notify: Restart nginx


# Here, we use the template module to copy the nginx.conf.j2 template to /etc/nginx/sites-available/default, which is the default configuration file for nginx. 
# We also include a notify directive to trigger the Restart nginx handler when the task is complete.
